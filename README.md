* User must be able to login (“login” page)
* After the user logins in, they are taken to a page that displays the trips they
are a part of. (we’ll call this the “trips” page)
* On the trips page, there should be a button that allows the user to create a trip (“create trip” page)
* On the create trip page, users should be allowed to create a trip with the minimum of the following information (trip name, destination, and ONE friend)
* Upon creation, this information must be stored in a database

# MM200
* The friend on the trip must be a user in the system
  * We recommend adding the friend via your form using a dropdown
* Each user can see the trips they are a part of on their trips page
  * ONLY need to show the trip name and destination
* The user should be able to delete any trip
  * You can use any method you want, but we recommend using jQuery to remove elements from the DOM and make an ajax call to a method to delete information from the table
